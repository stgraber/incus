# API extensions

The changes below were introduced to the Incus API after the 1.0 API was finalized.

They are all backward compatible and can be detected by client tools by
looking at the `api_extensions` field in `GET /1.0`.

## `storage_zfs_remove_snapshots`

A `storage.zfs_remove_snapshots` daemon configuration key was introduced.

It's a Boolean that defaults to `false` and that when set to `true` instructs Incus
to remove any needed snapshot when attempting to restore another.

This is needed as ZFS will only let you restore the latest snapshot.

## `container_host_shutdown_timeout`

A `boot.host_shutdown_timeout` container configuration key was introduced.

It's an integer which indicates how long Incus should wait for the container
to stop before killing it.

Its value is only used on clean Incus daemon shutdown. It defaults to 30s.

## `container_stop_priority`

A `boot.stop.priority` container configuration key was introduced.

It's an integer which indicates the priority of a container during shutdown.

Containers will shutdown starting with the highest priority level.

Containers with the same priority will shutdown in parallel.  It defaults to 0.

## `container_syscall_filtering`

A number of new syscalls related container configuration keys were introduced.

* `security.syscalls.blacklist_default` <!-- wokeignore:rule=blacklist -->
* `security.syscalls.blacklist_compat` <!-- wokeignore:rule=blacklist -->
* `security.syscalls.blacklist` <!-- wokeignore:rule=blacklist -->
* `security.syscalls.whitelist` <!-- wokeignore:rule=whitelist -->

See [Instance configuration](instance-config) for how to use them.

## `auth_pki`

This indicates support for PKI authentication mode.

In this mode, the client and server both must use certificates issued by the same PKI.

See [Security](security.md) for details.

## `container_last_used_at`

A `last_used_at` field was added to the `GET /1.0/containers/<name>` endpoint.

It is a timestamp of the last time the container was started.

If a container has been created but not started yet, `last_used_at` field
will be `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`

## `etag`

Add support for the ETag header on all relevant endpoints.

This adds the following HTTP header on answers to GET:

* ETag (SHA-256 of user modifiable content)

And adds support for the following HTTP header on PUT requests:

* If-Match (ETag value retrieved through previous GET)

This makes it possible to GET an Incus object, modify it and PUT it without
risking to hit a race condition where Incus or another client modified the
object in the meantime.

## `patch`

Add support for the HTTP PATCH method.

PATCH allows for partial update of an object in place of PUT.

## `usb_devices`

Add support for USB hotplug.

## `https_allowed_credentials`

To use Incus API with all Web Browsers (via SPAs) you must send credentials
(certificate) with each XHR (in order for this to happen, you should set
[`withCredentials=true`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials)
flag to each XHR Request).

Some browsers like Firefox and Safari can't accept server response without
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header. To ensure that the server will
return a response with that header, set `core.https_allowed_credentials=true`.

## `image_compression_algorithm`

This adds support for a `compression_algorithm` property when creating an image (`POST /1.0/images`).

Setting this property overrides the server default value (`images.compression_algorithm`).

## `directory_manipulation`

This allows for creating and listing directories via the Incus API, and exports
the file type via the X-Incus-type header, which can be either `file` or
`directory` right now.

## `container_cpu_time`

This adds support for retrieving CPU time for a running container.

## `storage_zfs_use_refquota`

Introduces a new server property `storage.zfs_use_refquota` which instructs Incus
to set the `refquota` property instead of `quota` when setting a size limit
on a container. Incus will also then use `usedbydataset` in place of `used`
when being queried about disk utilization.

This effectively controls whether disk usage by snapshots should be
considered as part of the container's disk space usage.

## `storage_lvm_mount_options`

Adds a new `storage.lvm_mount_options` daemon configuration option
which defaults to `discard` and allows the user to set addition mount
options for the file system used by the LVM LV.

## `network`

Network management API for Incus.

This includes:

* Addition of the `managed` property on `/1.0/networks` entries
* All the network configuration options (see [Network configuration](networks.md) for details)
* `POST /1.0/networks` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `PUT /1.0/networks/<entry>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `PATCH /1.0/networks/<entry>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `DELETE /1.0/networks/<entry>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `ipv4.address` property on `nic` type devices (when `nictype` is `bridged`)
* `ipv6.address` property on `nic` type devices (when `nictype` is `bridged`)
* `security.mac_filtering` property on `nic` type devices (when `nictype` is `bridged`)

## `profile_usedby`

Adds a new `used_by` field to profile entries listing the containers that are using it.

## `container_push`

When a container is created in push mode, the client serves as a proxy between
the source and target server. This is useful in cases where the target server
is behind a NAT or firewall and cannot directly communicate with the source
server and operate in pull mode.

## `container_exec_recording`

Introduces a new Boolean `record-output`, parameter to
`/1.0/containers/<name>/exec` which when set to `true` and combined with
with `wait-for-websocket` set to `false`, will record stdout and stderr to
disk and make them available through the logs interface.

The URL to the recorded output is included in the operation metadata
once the command is done running.

That output will expire similarly to other log files, typically after 48 hours.

## `certificate_update`

Adds the following to the REST API:

* ETag header on GET of a certificate
* PUT of certificate entries
* PATCH of certificate entries

## `container_exec_signal_handling`

Adds support `/1.0/containers/<name>/exec` for forwarding signals sent to the
client to the processes executing in the container. Currently SIGTERM and
SIGHUP are forwarded. Further signals that can be forwarded might be added
later.

## `gpu_devices`

Enables adding GPUs to a container.

## `container_image_properties`

Introduces a new `image` configuration key space. Read-only, includes the properties of the parent image.

## `migration_progress`

Transfer progress is now exported as part of the operation, on both sending and receiving ends.
This shows up as a `fs_progress` attribute in the operation metadata.

## `id_map`

Enables setting the `security.idmap.isolated` and `security.idmap.isolated`,
`security.idmap.size`, and `raw.id_map` fields.

## `network_firewall_filtering`

Add two new keys, `ipv4.firewall` and `ipv6.firewall` which if set to
`false` will turn off the generation of `iptables` FORWARDING rules. NAT
rules will still be added so long as the matching `ipv4.nat` or
`ipv6.nat` key is set to `true`.

Rules necessary for `dnsmasq` to work (DHCP/DNS) will always be applied if
`dnsmasq` is enabled on the bridge.

## `network_routes`

Introduces `ipv4.routes` and `ipv6.routes` which allow routing additional subnets to an Incus bridge.

## `storage`

Storage management API for Incus.

This includes:

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools`
* `POST /1.0/storage-pools` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `POST /1.0/storage-pools/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `PUT /1.0/storage-pools/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `PATCH /1.0/storage-pools/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `DELETE /1.0/storage-pools/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools/<name>/volumes` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools/<name>/volumes/<volume_type>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `POST /1.0/storage-pools/<name>/volumes/<volume_type>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<volume_type>/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `POST /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<volume_type>/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `PUT /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<volume_type>/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `PATCH /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<volume_type>/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)
* `DELETE /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<volume_type>/<name>` (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details)

* All storage configuration options (see [Storage configuration](storage.md) for details)

## `file_delete`

Implements `DELETE` in `/1.0/containers/<name>/files`

## `file_append`

Implements the `X-Incus-write` header which can be one of `overwrite` or `append`.

## `network_dhcp_expiry`

Introduces `ipv4.dhcp.expiry` and `ipv6.dhcp.expiry` allowing to set the DHCP lease expiry time.

## `storage_lvm_vg_rename`

Introduces the ability to rename a volume group by setting `storage.lvm.vg_name`.

## `storage_lvm_thinpool_rename`

Introduces the ability to rename a thin pool name by setting `storage.thinpool_name`.

## `network_vlan`

This adds a new `vlan` property to `macvlan` network devices.

When set, this will instruct Incus to attach to the specified VLAN. Incus
will look for an existing interface for that VLAN on the host. If one
can't be found it will create one itself and then use that as the
macvlan parent.

## `image_create_aliases`

Adds a new `aliases` field to `POST /1.0/images` allowing for aliases to
be set at image creation/import time.

## `container_stateless_copy`

This introduces a new `live` attribute in `POST /1.0/containers/<name>`.
Setting it to `false` tells Incus not to attempt running state transfer.

## `container_only_migration`

Introduces a new Boolean `container_only` attribute. When set to `true` only the
container will be copied or moved.

## `storage_zfs_clone_copy`

Introduces a new Boolean `storage_zfs_clone_copy` property for ZFS storage
pools. When set to `false` copying a container will be done through `zfs send` and
receive. This will make the target container independent of its source
container thus avoiding the need to keep dependent snapshots in the ZFS pool
around. However, this also entails less efficient storage usage for the
affected pool.
The default value for this property is `true`, i.e. space-efficient snapshots
will be used unless explicitly set to `false`.

## `unix_device_rename`

Introduces the ability to rename the `unix-block`/`unix-char` device inside container by setting `path`,
and the `source` attribute is added to specify the device on host.
If `source` is set without a `path`, we should assume that `path` will be the same as `source`.
If `path` is set without `source` and `major`/`minor` isn't set,
we should assume that `source` will be the same as `path`.
So at least one of them must be set.

## `storage_rsync_bwlimit`

When `rsync` has to be invoked to transfer storage entities setting `rsync.bwlimit`
places an upper limit on the amount of socket I/O allowed.

## `network_vxlan_interface`

This introduces a new `tunnel.NAME.interface` option for networks.

This key control what host network interface is used for a VXLAN tunnel.

## `storage_btrfs_mount_options`

This introduces the `btrfs.mount_options` property for Btrfs storage pools.

This key controls what mount options will be used for the Btrfs storage pool.

## `entity_description`

This adds descriptions to entities like containers, snapshots, networks, storage pools and volumes.

## `image_force_refresh`

This allows forcing a refresh for an existing image.

## `storage_lvm_lv_resizing`

This introduces the ability to resize logical volumes by setting the `size`
property in the containers root disk device.

## `id_map_base`

This introduces a new `security.idmap.base` allowing the user to skip the
map auto-selection process for isolated containers and specify what host
UID/GID to use as the base.

## `file_symlinks`

This adds support for transferring symlinks through the file API.
X-Incus-type can now be `symlink` with the request content being the target path.

## `container_push_target`

This adds the `target` field to `POST /1.0/containers/<name>` which can be
used to have the source Incus host connect to the target during migration.

## `network_vlan_physical`

Allows use of `vlan` property with `physical` network devices.

When set, this will instruct Incus to attach to the specified VLAN on the `parent` interface.
Incus will look for an existing interface for that `parent` and VLAN on the host.
If one can't be found it will create one itself.
Then, Incus will directly attach this interface to the container.

## `storage_images_delete`

This enabled the storage API to delete storage volumes for images from
a specific storage pool.

## `container_edit_metadata`

This adds support for editing a container `metadata.yaml` and related templates
via API, by accessing URLs under `/1.0/containers/<name>/metadata`. It can be used
to edit a container before publishing an image from it.

## `container_snapshot_stateful_migration`

This enables migrating stateful container snapshots to new containers.

## `storage_driver_ceph`

This adds a Ceph storage driver.

## `storage_ceph_user_name`

This adds the ability to specify the Ceph user.

## `instance_types`

This adds the `instance_type` field to the container creation request.
Its value is expanded to Incus resource limits.

## `storage_volatile_initial_source`

This records the actual source passed to Incus during storage pool creation.

## `storage_ceph_force_osd_reuse`

This introduces the `ceph.osd.force_reuse` property for the Ceph storage
driver. When set to `true` Incus will reuse an OSD storage pool that is already in
use by another Incus instance.

## `storage_block_filesystem_btrfs`

This adds support for Btrfs as a storage volume file system, in addition to `ext4`
and `xfs`.

## `resources`

This adds support for querying an Incus daemon for the system resources it has
available.

## `kernel_limits`

This adds support for setting process limits such as maximum number of open
files for the container via `nofile`. The format is `limits.kernel.[limit name]`.

## `storage_api_volume_rename`

This adds support for renaming custom storage volumes.

## `network_sriov`

This adds support for SR-IOV enabled network devices.

## `console`

This adds support to interact with the container console device and console log.

## `restrict_dev_incus`

A new `security.guestapi` container configuration key was introduced.
The key controls whether the `/dev/incus` interface is made available to the container.
If set to `false`, this effectively prevents the container from interacting with the Incus daemon.

## `migration_pre_copy`

This adds support for optimized memory transfer during live migration.

## `infiniband`

This adds support to use InfiniBand network devices.

## `dev_incus_events`

This adds a WebSocket API to the `/dev/incus` socket.

When connecting to `/1.0/events` over the `/dev/incus` socket, you will now be
getting a stream of events over WebSocket.

## `proxy`

This adds a new `proxy` device type to containers, allowing forwarding
of connections between the host and container.

## `network_dhcp_gateway`

Introduces a new `ipv4.dhcp.gateway` network configuration key to set an alternate gateway.

## `file_get_symlink`

This makes it possible to retrieve symlinks using the file API.

## `network_leases`

Adds a new `/1.0/networks/NAME/leases` API endpoint to query the lease database on
bridges which run an Incus-managed DHCP server.

## `unix_device_hotplug`

This adds support for the `required` property for Unix devices.

## `storage_api_local_volume_handling`

This add the ability to copy and move custom storage volumes locally in the
same and between storage pools.

## `operation_description`

Adds a `description` field to all operations.

## `clustering`

Clustering API for Incus.

This includes the following new endpoints (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details):

* `GET /1.0/cluster`
* `UPDATE /1.0/cluster`

* `GET /1.0/cluster/members`

* `GET /1.0/cluster/members/<name>`

* `GET /1.0/networks/<name>` accepts a new `target` query parameter

## `event_lifecycle`

This adds a new `lifecycle` message type to the events API.

## `storage_api_remote_volume_handling`

This adds the ability to copy and move custom storage volumes between remote.

## `nvidia_runtime`

Adds a `nvidia_runtime` configuration option for containers, setting this to
`true` will have the NVIDIA runtime and CUDA libraries passed to the
container.

## `container_mount_propagation`

This adds a new `propagation` option to the disk device type, allowing
the configuration of kernel mount propagation.

## `container_backup`

Add container backup support.

This includes the following new endpoints (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details):

* `GET /1.0/containers/<name>/backups`
* `POST /1.0/containers/<name>/backups`

* `GET /1.0/containers/<name>/backups/<name>`
* `POST /1.0/containers/<name>/backups/<name>`
* `DELETE /1.0/containers/<name>/backups/<name>`

* `GET /1.0/containers/<name>/backups/<name>/export`

The following existing endpoint has been modified:

* `POST /1.0/containers` accepts the new source type `backup`

## `dev_incus_images`

Adds a `security.guestapi.images` configuration option for containers which
controls the availability of a `/1.0/images/FINGERPRINT/export` API over
`/dev/incus`. This can be used by a container running nested Incus to access raw
images from the host.

## `container_local_cross_pool_handling`

This enables copying or moving containers between storage pools on the same Incus
instance.

## `proxy_unix`

Add support for both Unix sockets and abstract Unix sockets in proxy devices.
They can be used by specifying the address as `unix:/path/to/unix.sock` (normal
socket) or `unix:@/tmp/unix.sock` (abstract socket).

Supported connections are now:

* `TCP <-> TCP`
* `UNIX <-> UNIX`
* `TCP <-> UNIX`
* `UNIX <-> TCP`

## `proxy_udp`

Add support for UDP in proxy devices.

Supported connections are now:

* `TCP <-> TCP`
* `UNIX <-> UNIX`
* `TCP <-> UNIX`
* `UNIX <-> TCP`
* `UDP <-> UDP`
* `TCP <-> UDP`
* `UNIX <-> UDP`

## `clustering_join`

This makes `GET /1.0/cluster` return information about which storage pools and
networks are required to be created by joining nodes and which node-specific
configuration keys they are required to use when creating them. Likewise the `PUT
/1.0/cluster` endpoint now accepts the same format to pass information about
storage pools and networks to be automatically created before attempting to join
a cluster.

## `proxy_tcp_udp_multi_port_handling`

Adds support for forwarding traffic for multiple ports. Forwarding is allowed
between a range of ports if the port range is equal for source and target
(for example `1.2.3.4 0-1000 -> 5.6.7.8 1000-2000`) and between a range of source
ports and a single target port (for example `1.2.3.4 0-1000 -> 5.6.7.8 1000`).

## `network_state`

Adds support for retrieving a network's state.

This adds the following new endpoint (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details):

* `GET /1.0/networks/<name>/state`

## `proxy_unix_dac_properties`

This adds support for GID, UID, and mode properties for non-abstract Unix
sockets.

## `container_protection_delete`

Enables setting the `security.protection.delete` field which prevents containers
from being deleted if set to `true`. Snapshots are not affected by this setting.

## `proxy_priv_drop`

Adds `security.uid` and `security.gid` for the proxy devices, allowing
privilege dropping and effectively changing the UID/GID used for
connections to Unix sockets too.

## `pprof_http`

This adds a new `core.debug_address` configuration option to start a debugging HTTP server.

That server currently includes a `pprof` API and replaces the old
`cpu-profile`, `memory-profile` and `print-goroutines` debug options.

## `proxy_haproxy_protocol`

Adds a `proxy_protocol` key to the proxy device which controls the use of the HAProxy PROXY protocol header.

## `network_hwaddr`

Adds a `bridge.hwaddr` key to control the MAC address of the bridge.

## `proxy_nat`

This adds optimized UDP/TCP proxying. If the configuration allows, proxying
will be done via `iptables` instead of proxy devices.

## `network_nat_order`

This introduces the `ipv4.nat.order` and `ipv6.nat.order` configuration keys for Incus bridges.
Those keys control whether to put the Incus rules before or after any pre-existing rules in the chain.

## `container_full`

This introduces a new `recursion=2` mode for `GET /1.0/containers` which allows for the retrieval of
all container structs, including the state, snapshots and backup structs.

This effectively allows for [`incus list`](incus_list.md) to get all it needs in one query.

## `backup_compression`

This introduces a new `backups.compression_algorithm` configuration key which
allows configuration of backup compression.

## `nvidia_runtime_config`

This introduces a few extra configuration keys when using `nvidia.runtime` and the `libnvidia-container` library.
Those keys translate pretty much directly to the matching NVIDIA container environment variables:

* `nvidia.driver.capabilities` => `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES`
* `nvidia.require.cuda` => `NVIDIA_REQUIRE_CUDA`
* `nvidia.require.driver` => `NVIDIA_REQUIRE_DRIVER`

## `storage_api_volume_snapshots`

Add support for storage volume snapshots. They work like container snapshots,
only for volumes.

This adds the following new endpoint (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details):

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<type>/<name>/snapshots`
* `POST /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<type>/<name>/snapshots`

* `GET /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<type>/<volume>/snapshots/<name>`
* `PUT /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<type>/<volume>/snapshots/<name>`
* `POST /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<type>/<volume>/snapshots/<name>`
* `DELETE /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/volumes/<type>/<volume>/snapshots/<name>`

## `storage_unmapped`

Introduces a new `security.unmapped` Boolean on storage volumes.

Setting it to `true` will flush the current map on the volume and prevent
any further idmap tracking and remapping on the volume.

This can be used to share data between isolated containers after
attaching it to the container which requires write access.

## `projects`

Add a new project API, supporting creation, update and deletion of projects.

Projects can hold containers, profiles or images at this point and let
you get a separate view of your Incus resources by switching to it.

## `network_vxlan_ttl`

This adds a new `tunnel.NAME.ttl` network configuration option which
makes it possible to raise the TTL on VXLAN tunnels.

## `container_incremental_copy`

This adds support for incremental container copy. When copying a container
using the `--refresh` flag, only the missing or outdated files will be
copied over. Should the target container not exist yet, a normal copy operation
is performed.

## `usb_optional_vendorid`

As the name implies, the `vendorid` field on USB devices attached to
containers has now been made optional, allowing for all USB devices to
be passed to a container (similar to what's done for GPUs).

## `snapshot_scheduling`

This adds support for snapshot scheduling. It introduces three new
configuration keys: `snapshots.schedule`, `snapshots.schedule.stopped`, and
`snapshots.pattern`. Snapshots can be created automatically up to every minute.

## `snapshots_schedule_aliases`

Snapshot schedule can be configured by a comma-separated list of schedule aliases.
Available aliases are `<@hourly> <@daily> <@midnight> <@weekly> <@monthly> <@annually> <@yearly> <@startup>` for instances,
and `<@hourly> <@daily> <@midnight> <@weekly> <@monthly> <@annually> <@yearly>` for storage volumes.

## `container_copy_project`

Introduces a `project` field to the container source JSON object, allowing for
copy/move of containers between projects.

## `clustering_server_address`

This adds support for configuring a server network address which differs from
the REST API client network address. When bootstrapping a new cluster, clients
can set the new `cluster.https_address` configuration key to specify the address of
the initial server. When joining a new server, clients can set the
`core.https_address` configuration key of the joining server to the REST API
address the joining server should listen at, and set the `server_address`
key in the `PUT /1.0/cluster` API to the address the joining server should
use for clustering traffic (the value of `server_address` will be
automatically copied to the `cluster.https_address` configuration key of the
joining server).

## `clustering_image_replication`

Enable image replication across the nodes in the cluster.
A new `cluster.images_minimal_replica` configuration key was introduced can be used
to specify to the minimal numbers of nodes for image replication.

## `container_protection_shift`

Enables setting the `security.protection.shift` option which prevents containers
from having their file system shifted.

## `snapshot_expiry`

This adds support for snapshot expiration. The task is run minutely. The configuration
option `snapshots.expiry` takes an expression in the form of `1M 2H 3d 4w 5m
6y` (1 minute, 2 hours, 3 days, 4 weeks, 5 months, 6 years), however not all
parts have to be used.

Snapshots which are then created will be given an expiry date based on the
expression. This expiry date, defined by `expires_at`, can be manually edited
using the API or [`incus config edit`](incus_config_edit.md). Snapshots with a valid expiry date will be
removed when the task in run. Expiry can be disabled by setting `expires_at` to
an empty string or `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` (zero time). This is the default if
`snapshots.expiry` is not set.

This adds the following new endpoint (see [RESTful API](rest-api.md) for details):

* `PUT /1.0/containers/<name>/snapshots/<name>`

## `snapshot_expiry_creation`

Adds `expires_at` to container creation, allowing for override of a
snapshot's expiry at creation time.

## `network_leases_location`

Introduces a `Location` field in the leases list.
This is used when querying a cluster to show what node a particular
lease was found on.

## `resources_cpu_socket`

Add Socket field to CPU resources in case we get out of order socket information.

## `resources_gpu`

Add a new GPU struct to the server resources, listing all usable GPUs on the system.

## `resources_numa`

Shows the NUMA node for all CPUs and GPUs.

## `kernel_features`

Exposes the state of optional kernel features through the server environment.

## `id_map_current`

This introduces a new internal `volatile.idmap.current` key which is
used to track the current mapping for the container.

This effectively gives us:

* `volatile.last_state.idmap` => On-disk idmap
* `volatile.idmap.current` => Current kernel map

by a container that a registered syscall has been performed. Incus can then
decide to trigger various actions.

## `lxc_features`

This introduces the `lxc_features` section output from the [`incus info`](incus_info.md) command
via the `GET /1.0` route. It outputs the result of checks for key features being present in the
underlying LXC library.

elevated permissions.

## `container_disk_shift`

Adds the `shift` property on `disk` devices which controls the use of the `idmapped mounts` overlay.

## `storage_shifted`

Introduces a new `security.shifted` Boolean on storage volumes.

Setting it to `true` will allow multiple isolated containers to attach the
same storage volume while keeping the file system writable from all of
them.

This makes use of `idmapped mounts` as an overlay file system.

## `resources_infiniband`

Export InfiniBand character device information (`issm`, `umad`, `uverb`) as part of the resources API.

Setting this property overrides the server default value (`backups.compression_algorithm`).

## `ceph_data_pool_name`

This adds support for an optional argument (`ceph.osd.data_pool_name`) when creating
storage pools using Ceph RBD, when this argument is used the pool will store it's
actual data in the pool specified with `data_pool_name` while keeping the metadata
in the pool specified by `pool_name`.

## `container_syscall_intercept_mount`

Adds the `security.syscalls.intercept.mount`,
`security.syscalls.intercept.mount.allowed`, and
`security.syscalls.intercept.mount.shift` configuration keys to control whether
and how the `mount` system call will be intercepted by Incus and processed with
elevated permissions.

The new `cluster.max_voters` and `cluster.max_standby` configuration keys were introduced
to specify to the ideal number of database voter and standbys.

## `firewall_driver`

Adds the `Firewall` property to the `ServerEnvironment` struct indicating the firewall driver being used.

## `storage_lvm_vg_force_reuse`

Introduces the ability to create a storage pool from an existing non-empty volume group.
This option should be used with care, as Incus can then not guarantee that volume name conflicts won't occur
with non-Incus created volumes in the same volume group.
This could also potentially lead to Incus deleting a non-Incus volume should name conflicts occur.

## `container_syscall_intercept_hugetlbfs`

When mount syscall interception is enabled and `hugetlbfs` is specified as an
allowed file system type Incus will mount a separate `hugetlbfs` instance for the
container with the UID and GID mount options set to the container's root UID
and GID. This ensures that processes in the container can use huge pages.

## `limits_hugepages`

This allows to limit the number of huge pages a container can use through the
`hugetlb` cgroup. This means the `hugetlb` cgroup needs to be available. Note, that
limiting huge pages is recommended when intercepting the mount syscall for the
`hugetlbfs` file system to avoid allowing the container to exhaust the host's
huge pages resources.

## `container_nic_routed_gateway`

This introduces the `ipv4.gateway` and `ipv6.gateway` NIC configuration keys that can take a value of either `auto` or
`none`. The default value for the key if unspecified is `auto`. This will cause the current behavior of a default
gateway being added inside the container and the same gateway address being added to the host-side interface.
If the value is set to `none` then no default gateway nor will the address be added to the host-side interface.
This allows multiple routed NIC devices to be added to a container.

## `projects_restrictions`

This introduces support for the `restricted` configuration key on project, which
can prevent the use of security-sensitive features in a project.

## `custom_volume_snapshot_expiry`

This allows custom volume snapshots to expiry.
Expiry dates can be set individually, or by setting the `snapshots.expiry` configuration key on the parent custom volume which then automatically applies to all created snapshots.

This adds support for custom volume snapshot scheduling. It introduces two new
configuration keys: `snapshots.schedule` and
`snapshots.pattern`. Snapshots can be created automatically up to every minute.

## `trust_ca_certificates`

This allows for checking client certificates trusted by the provided CA (`server.ca`).
It can be enabled by setting `core.trust_ca_certificates` to `true`.
If enabled, it will perform the check, and bypass the trusted password if `true`.
An exception will be made if the connecting client certificate is in the provided CRL (`ca.crl`).
In this case, it will ask for the password.

## `snapshot_disk_usage`

This adds a new `size` field to the output of `/1.0/instances/<name>/snapshots/<snapshot>` which represents the disk usage of the snapshot.

## `clustering_edit_roles`

This adds a writable endpoint for cluster members, allowing the editing of their roles.

## `container_nic_routed_host_address`

This introduces the `ipv4.host_address` and `ipv6.host_address` NIC configuration keys that can be used to control the
host-side `veth` interface's IP addresses. This can be useful when using multiple routed NICs at the same time and
needing a predictable next-hop address to use.

This also alters the behavior of `ipv4.gateway` and `ipv6.gateway` NIC configuration keys. When they are set to `auto`
the container will have its default gateway set to the value of `ipv4.host_address` or `ipv6.host_address` respectively.

The default values are:

`ipv4.host_address`: `169.254.0.1`
`ipv6.host_address`: `fe80::1`

This is backward compatible with the previous default behavior.

## `container_nic_ipvlan_gateway`

This introduces the `ipv4.gateway` and `ipv6.gateway` NIC configuration keys that can take a value of either `auto` or
`none`. The default value for the key if unspecified is `auto`. This will cause the current behavior of a default
gateway being added inside the container and the same gateway address being added to the host-side interface.
If the value is set to `none` then no default gateway nor will the address be added to the host-side interface.
This allows multiple IPVLAN NIC devices to be added to a container.

## `resources_usb_pci`

This adds USB and PCI devices to the output of `/1.0/resources`.

## `resources_cpu_threads_numa`

for the instance's IPs to a custom policy routing table by ID.

## `container_nic_ipvlan_mode`

This introduces the `mode` NIC configuration key that can be used to switch the `ipvlan` mode into either `l2` or `l3s`.
If not specified, the default value is `l3s` (which is the old behavior).

In `l2` mode the `ipv4.address` and `ipv6.address` keys will accept addresses in either CIDR or singular formats.
If singular format is used, the default subnet size is taken to be /24 and /64 for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.

In `l2` mode the `ipv4.gateway` and `ipv6.gateway` keys accept only a singular IP address.

## `resources_system`

This adds system information to the output of `/1.0/resources`.

## `gpu_mig_uuid`

Adds support for the new MIG UUID format used by NVIDIA `470+` drivers (for example, `MIG-74c6a31a-fde5-5c61-973b-70e12346c202`),
the `MIG-` prefix can be omitted

This extension supersedes old `mig.gi` and `mig.ci` parameters which are kept for compatibility with old drivers and
cannot be set together.

If not specified, all networks are accessible (assuming it is also allowed by the `restricted.devices.nic` setting, described below).

This also introduces a change whereby network access is controlled by the project's `restricted.devices.nic` setting:

* If `restricted.devices.nic` is set to `managed` (the default if not specified), only managed networks are accessible.
* If `restricted.devices.nic` is set to `allow`, all networks are accessible (dependent on the `restricted.networks.access` setting).
* If `restricted.devices.nic` is set to `block`, no networks are accessible.

## `storage_buckets_local`

This introduces the ability to use storage buckets on local storage pools by setting the new `core.storage_buckets_address` global configuration setting.

This adds the `CreatedAt` field to the `StorageVolume` and `StorageVolumeSnapshot` API types.

## `cpu_hotplug`
This adds CPU hotplugging for VMs.
Hotplugging is disabled when using CPU pinning, because this would require hotplugging NUMA devices as well, which is not possible.

## `projects_networks_zones`

This adds support for the `features.networks.zones` project feature, which changes which project network zones are
associated with when they are created. Previously network zones were tied to the value of `features.networks`,
meaning they were created in the same project as networks were.

Now this has been decoupled from `features.networks` to allow projects that share a network in the default project
(i.e those with `features.networks=false`) to have their own project level DNS zones that give a project oriented
"view" of the addresses on that shared network (which only includes addresses from instances in their project).

This also introduces a change to the network `dns.zone.forward` setting, which now accepts a comma-separated of
DNS zone names (a maximum of one per project) in order to associate a shared network with multiple zones.

No change to the `dns.zone.reverse.*` settings have been made, they still only allow a single DNS zone to be set.
However the resulting zone content that is generated now includes `PTR` records covering addresses from all
projects that are referencing that network via one of their forward zones.

Existing projects that have `features.networks=true` will have `features.networks.zones=true` set automatically,
but new projects will need to specify this explicitly.

## `instance_nic_txqueuelength`

Adds a `txqueuelen` key to control the `txqueuelen` parameter of the NIC device.

The Starlark scriptlet is provided to Incus via the new global configuration option `instances.placement.scriptlet`.

## `storage_pool_source_wipe`
Adds support for a `source.wipe` Boolean on the storage pool, indicating
that Incus should wipe partition headers off the requested disk rather
than potentially fail due to pre-existing file systems.

## `zfs_block_mode`

This adds support for using ZFS block {spellexception}`filesystem` volumes allowing the use of different file systems on top of ZFS.

This adds the following new configuration options for ZFS storage pools:

* `volume.zfs.block_mode`
* `volume.block.mount_options`
* `volume.block.filesystem`

## `instance_generation_id`

Adds support for instance generation ID. The VM or container generation ID will change whenever the instance's place in time moves backwards. As of now, the generation ID is only exposed through to VM type instances. This allows for the VM guest OS to reinitialize any state it needs to avoid duplicating potential state that has already occurred:

* `volatile.uuid.generation`

## `disk_io_cache`
This introduces a new `io.cache` property to disk devices which can be used to override the VM caching behavior.

## `amd_sev`
Adds support for AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) that can be used to encrypt the memory of a guest VM.

This adds the following new configuration options for SEV encryption:

* `security.sev` : (bool) is SEV enabled for this VM

## `storage_pool_loop_resize`
This allows growing loop file backed storage pools by changing the `size` setting of the pool.

## `migration_vm_live`
This adds support for performing VM QEMU to QEMU live migration for both shared storage (clustered Ceph) and
non-shared storage pools.

This also adds the `CRIUType_VM_QEMU` value of `3` for the migration `CRIUType` `protobuf` field.

## `ovn_nic_nesting`
This adds support for nesting an `ovn` NIC inside another `ovn` NIC on the same instance.
This allows for an OVN logical switch port to be tunneled inside another OVN NIC using VLAN tagging.

This feature is configured by specifying the parent NIC name using the `nested` property and the VLAN ID to use for tunneling with the `vlan` property.

## `oidc`

This adds support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.

This adds the following new configuration keys:

* `oidc.issuer`
* `oidc.client.id`
* `oidc.audience`

## `network_ovn_l3only`
This adds the ability to set an `ovn` network into "layer 3 only" mode.
This mode can be enabled at IPv4 or IPv6 level using `ipv4.l3only` and `ipv6.l3only` configuration options respectively.

With this mode enabled the following changes are made to the network:

* The virtual router's internal port address will be configured with a single host netmask (e.g. /32 for IPv4 or /128 for IPv6).
* Static routes for active instance NIC addresses will be added to the virtual router.
* A discard route for the entire internal subnet will be added to the virtual router to prevent packets destined for inactive addresses from escaping to the uplink network.
* The DHCPv4 server will be configured to indicate that a netmask of 255.255.255.255 be used for instance configuration.

## `ovn_nic_acceleration_vdpa`

This updates the `ovn_nic_acceleration` API extension. The `acceleration` configuration key for OVN NICs can now takes the value `vdpa` to support Virtual Data Path Acceleration (VDPA).

## `cluster_healing`
This adds cluster healing which automatically evacuates offline cluster members.

This adds the following new configuration key:

* `cluster.healing_threshold`

The configuration key takes an integer, and can be disabled by setting it to 0 (default). If set, the value represents the threshold after which an offline cluster member is to be evacuated. In case the value is lower than `cluster.offline_threshold`, that value will be used instead.

When the offline cluster member is evacuated, only remote-backed instances will be migrated. Local instances will be ignored as there is no way of migrating them once the cluster member is offline.

## `instances_state_total`
This extension adds a new `total` field to `InstanceStateDisk` and `InstanceStateMemory`, both part of the instance's state API.

## `custom_volume_iso`
This adds the possibility to import ISO images as custom storage volumes.

This adds the `--type` flag to [`incus storage volume import`](incus_storage_volume_import.md).

## `network_allocations`
This adds the possibility to list an Incus deployment's network allocations.

Through the [`incus network list-allocations`](incus_network_list-allocations.md) command and the `--project <PROJECT> | --all-projects` flags,
you can list all the used IP addresses, hardware addresses (for instances), resource URIs and whether it uses NAT for
each `instance`, `network`, `network forward` and `network load-balancer`.

## `zfs_delegate`
This implements a new `zfs.delegate` volume Boolean for volumes on a ZFS storage driver.
When enabled and a suitable system is in use (requires ZFS 2.2 or higher), the ZFS dataset will be delegated to the container, allowing for its use through the `zfs` command line tool.

## `storage_api_remote_volume_snapshot_copy`

This allows copying storage volume snapshots to and from remotes.

## `operations_get_query_all_projects`

This introduces support for the `all-projects` query parameter for the GET API calls to both `/1.0/operations` and `/1.0/operations?recursion=1`.
This parameter allows bypassing the project name filter.

## `metadata_configuration`
Adds the `GET /1.0/metadata/configuration` API endpoint to retrieve the generated metadata configuration in a JSON format. The JSON structure adopts the structure ```"configs" > `ENTITY` > `ENTITY_SECTION` > "keys" > [<CONFIG_OPTION_0>, <CONFIG_OPTION_1>, ...]```.
Check the list of {doc}`configuration options </config-options>` to see which configuration options are included.

## `syslog_socket`

## `disk_initial_volume_configuration`

This API extension provides the capability to set initial volume configurations for instance root devices.
Initial volume configurations are prefixed with `initial.` and can be specified either through profiles or directly
during instance initialization using the `--device` flag.

Note that these configuration are applied only at the time of instance creation and subsequent modifications have
no effect on existing devices.

## `operation_wait`

This API extension indicates that the `/1.0/operations/{id}/wait` endpoint exists on the server. This indicates to the client
that the endpoint can be used to wait for an operation to complete rather than waiting for an operation event via the
`/1.0/events` endpoint.

## `image_restriction_privileged`

This extension adds a new image restriction, `requirements.privileged` which when `false` indicates that an image cannot be run in a privileged container.

## `cluster_internal_custom_volume_copy`

This extension adds support for copying and moving custom storage volumes within a cluster with a single API call.
Calling `POST /1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/custom?target=<target>` will copy the custom volume specified in the `source` part of the request.

for the attached disk to be connected to the `virtio-blk` bus.

## `loki_config_instance`

Adds a new `loki.instance` server configuration key to customize the `instance` field in Loki events.
This can be used to expose the name of the cluster rather than the individual system name sending
the event as that's usually already covered by the `location` field.

## `instance_create_start`

Adds a new `start` field to the `POST /1.0/instances` API which when set
to `true` will have the instance automatically start upon creation.

In this scenario, the creation and startup is part of a single background operation.

## `clustering_evacuation_stop_options`

With this, it's possible to have a single shared LVM pool across multiple servers so long as they all see the same backing device(s).

## `shared_custom_block_volumes`

This adds a new configuration key `security.shared` to custom block volumes.
If unset or `false`, the custom block volume cannot be attached to multiple instances.
This feature was added to prevent data loss which can happen when custom block volumes are attached to multiple instances at once.

## `auth_tls_jwt`

This adds the ability to use a signed `JSON Web Token` (`JWT`) instead of using the TLS client certificate directly.

In this scenario, the client derives a `JWT` from their own TLS client certificate providing it as a `bearer` token through the `Authorization` HTTP header.

The `JWT` must have the certificate's fingerprint as its `Subject` and must be signed by the client's private key.

Feature has been added, to make it possible to distinguish between devices with identical `vendorid` and `productid`.

## `numa_cpu_balanced`

This adds `balanced` as a new value for `limits.cpu.nodes`.

When set to `balanced`, Incus will attempt to select the least busy NUMA
node at startup time for the instance, trying to keep the load spread
across NUMA nodes on the system.

## `image_restriction_nesting`

This extension adds a new image restriction, `requirements.nesting` which when `true` indicates that an image cannot be run without nesting.

## `network_integrations`

Adds the concept of network integrations and initial support for OVN Interconnection.

New API:

* `/1.0/network-integrations` (GET, POST)
* `/1.0/network-integrations/NAME` (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, POST)

Each integration is made of:

* name
* description
* type (only `ovn` for now)
* configuration
   * `ovn.northbound_connection` (database connection string for the OVN Interconnection database)
   * `ovn.ca_cert` (optional, SSL CA certificate for the OVN Interconnection database)
   * `ovn.client_cert` (optional, SSL client certificate to connect to the OVN Interconnection database)
   * `ovn.client_key` (optional, SSL client key to connect to the OVN Interconnection database)
   * `ovn.transit.pattern` (Pongo2 template to generate the transit switch name)

Those integrations attach to network peers through some new fields:

* `type` (`local` for current behavior, `remote` for integrations)
* `target_integration` (reference to the integration)
